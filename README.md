# Image Classification Project

A Python-based project implementing image classification using deep learning techniques. This repository includes code to train, evaluate, and test convolutional neural network (CNN) models on common image datasets for categorizing images into predefined classes.

## Features

- Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
- Supports training on popular datasets like CIFAR-10 or custom image datasets.
- Includes data preprocessing and augmentation steps.
- Provides model evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
- Compatible with Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Modular code structure for easy extension and customization.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ayushpratapno1/image-classification.git

cd image-classification


Install the required dependencies. You may use a virtual environment and install packages like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and others based on your implementation:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset or use the provided sample dataset (like CIFAR-10).
2. Run the training script to train the CNN model on your dataset:

python train.py


3. After training, evaluate the model's performance:

python evaluate.py


4. Use the trained model for image classification on new images:

python predict.py --image <path_to_image>


Check for any command-line options in each script by running:

python train.py --help
python evaluate.py --help
python predict.py --help


## How It Works

This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and classify them into various categories. The network is trained on labeled datasets by optimizing a loss function using backpropagation and an optimizer such as Adam or SGD. Data augmentation helps to improve generalization performance.

## Use Cases

- Academic projects on image classification and computer vision.
- Building custom image classification models for specific datasets.
- Learning and experimenting with deep learning techniques in Python.
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning on pretrained CNN models.
